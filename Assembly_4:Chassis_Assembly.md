## 4. Chassis Assembly

###	Brackets

Tools:
-	Phillips head screw driver

Parts:
-	Chassis kit: The kit comes with two pairs of brackets and two laser-cut plates.  These laser-cut plates are not used, they can be thrown away.  The Swarmie is made with three laser-cut plates packaged separately.

Using eight M3x6mm screws, attach all four brackets together as seen in the following images.  Note that the two side brackets are not symmetrical and should be attached in the same orientation.

###	Motors

Attach motors to mounting holes using two M3x4mm screws per motor.  The motor shaft should be towards the bottom of the chassis.  See below for detail.

###	Tire Assembly

Wheel assembly instructions have been adapted from Lynxmotion’s instructions found [here](http://www.lynxmotion.com/images/html/build007.htm).

**Important:** half of the wheels must be assembled opposite to the other half.  This is to make sure that when they are attached to the Swarmie, they are all facing the same direction.  Example below:

![Wheels Opposite](http://swarmathon.cs.unm.edu/img/WheelsOpposite.jpg)
 
Notice that the tread is pointed in the same direction, but the inner wheels are in opposite orientations.

1.	First use a utility knife, or similar, to carefully remove any imperfections on the inner part of the rim. This will make things much easier later on.

  Figure 12

2.	Pull one side of the tire out, so that it protrudes, like in the image. Insert one side of the rim. It helps to insert at an angle in the middle, where the opening is the largest. Rotate the rim slowly, while pressing it in, to help coax it into place.

  ![Tire 2](http://swarmathon.cs.unm.edu/img/tire02.jpg)

3.	You should end up with the tire and rim looking like Figure 14.

  ![Tire 3](http://swarmathon.cs.unm.edu/img/tire03.jpg)

4.	Pull out the side of the tire again, so that it looks like Figure 15.

  ![Tire 4](http://swarmathon.cs.unm.edu/img/tire04.jpg)
  
  Figure 15

5.	Gently press and rotate the rim into the tire. You want to end up with the rim almost fully into the tire with the bead still sticking out, as in Figure 16. If there are any imperfections leftover from Step 1, then it may be difficult to pass the tire over them.

  Figure 16

6.	Quickly press the rim into the tire from both sides. The bead should now be completely in the flange. This step may require several attempts.

7.	Flip the tire over. It should look something like Figure 18.

  Figure 18

8.	Almost half the bead is in the flange. Just hold that side in and pull the rest of the bead away from the center, and it will retract back into the flange. It may be helpful to use a screw driver to pull the tire over the wheel.

9.	A completed tire is shown in Figure 20.

###	Bottom Plate and Battery

Tools:
-	1/16” hex key
-	3/32” hex key
-	¼” nut driver

Parts:
-	8x 4-40x1.5” screws – 3/32” hex key
-	4x 4-40x1/2” screws – 1/16” hex key
-	4x M3x6mm – 2.0mm hex key
-	16x washers
-	8x 4-40 nyloc nuts – ¼” nut driver
-	Bottom Plate
-	Battery Base
-	Battery Brace
-	Battery Cross Strap
-	Battery
-	Fire retardant bag

Remove the protective paper film from the bottom plate, if you have not already. 

Using eight 4-40x1.5” screws and nyloc nuts, attach the battery base and battery brace.  The top of the battery brace has rounded edges. Use washers on both sides of the screws.  Make sure the screw heads are on the bottom.  The nylon inserts in the nyloc nuts should always face away from the screw heads.

![Bottom Plate w/ Battery Frame](http://swarmathon.cs.unm.edu/img/BottomPlateWithBatteryFrame.jpg)

The bottom of the chassis is the side in which the motor shafts are closest. Using four M3x6mm screws, attach the bottom plate to the bottom of the chassis. The plate can be attached in either orientation that it fits.  The orientation will matter later, when the wheels are attached.

![Bottom Plate Attached](http://swarmathon.cs.unm.edu/img/BottomPlateAttached.jpg)

Insert the battery into the fire retardant bag in the following way.  With the bag’s warning facing you, insert the battery with the wire leads coming out on the right, and the battery’s warning facing you.  

![Battery Out of Bag](http://swarmathon.cs.unm.edu/img/BatteryOutOfBag.jpg)

Close the Velcro flap and wrap it around the back of the bag as tightly as possible.  This is necessary to properly fit into the battery base.  

![Battery In Bag](http://swarmathon.cs.unm.edu/img/BatteryInBag.jpg)

Carefully lay the battery into the chassis to keep the bag tight. To maintain the tightness of the bag, insert it into the battery brace flap-side first, while holding onto the flap from underneath.

![Battery Slide in](http://swarmathon.cs.unm.edu/img/BatterySlideIn.jpg)

Then lower the other side to the battery base and press it in. The flap of the battery should be against the black acrylic of the bottom plate.

![Battery in Place](http://swarmathon.cs.unm.edu/img/BatteryInPlace.jpg)

Next, use four 4-40x1/2” screws (button head) to screw the battery cross strap to the battery base and battery brace.  This strap fits only one way, line up the holes and be sure that the flat side is against the battery.

###	Wheel Attachment

Tools:
-	3/32” hex key
-	3.5mm hex key

Parts:
-	2x mounting hub kit
-	4x assembled tires

Each mounting hub kit will contain two mounting hubs, two larger wheel screws, and three set screws. One set screw is extra.

Begin by screwing the wheel screws into the mounting hubs. Then slide the mounting hubs onto the motor shafts and screw on the set screw. The set screw has a hexagonal slot on one side to fit a 3/32" hex key, and should be screwed into the flat side of the motor shaft. The wheel screws are screwed on first to ensure the mounting hub is attached at the correct distance from the motor.  

![Mounting Hub](http://swarmathon.cs.unm.edu/img/MountingHub.jpg)

Unscrew the wheel screws, fit the wheel onto the mounting hub, and screw the wheel screw back in.  In the picture below you can see the direction in which the tires should be pointed.  The rear of the robot is considered to be the side of the larger battery base.
