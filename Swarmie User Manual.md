### Demonstration Mode Testing

Please unpack your robot and check for any physical damage before beginning this tutorial. If you notice any damage, please notify a NASA Swarmathon representative as soon as possible at [Info@NasaSwarmathon.com](Info@NasaSwarmathon.com). Once unpacked, place your robot on a large, flat surface, such as a parking lot, then follow the directions below:

1. Connect the battery by plugging the black barrel connector into the PCB

2. Turn on the power to the motors by flipping the red switch up

3. Turn on the Intel NUC by pressing the power button on top, in the front left corner of the NUC

4. Wait 30 to 60 seconds, then the robot should begin moving

Observe the robot for several minutes. You should see the robot performing a correlated random walk by rotating to a random heading, driving forward 50 cm, then rotating, then driving, etc. If you place an obstacle in front of the robot, you should observe the robot turning away to avoid the obstacle, then resuming the random walk behavior. If everything is working correctly, you should observe the following indicator lights:

1. A solid green light on the camera

2. A rapidly blinking green light on all three ultrasonic sensors

3. A solid green light on the GPS board on the right side of the robot, and possibly a slow blinking red light if the robot is outside and has achieved a GPS lock

4. A very rapidly blinking, near-solid red light on the microcontroller underneath the Intel NUC
